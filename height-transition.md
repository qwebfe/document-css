# Transitions an element's height from `0` to `auto` when its height is unknown.

- `transition: max-height: 0.5s cubic-bezier(...)` specifies that changes to `max-height` should be transitioned over 0.5 seconds, using an `ease-out-quint` timing function.
- `overflow: hidden` prevents the contents of the hidden element from overflowing its container.
- `max-height: 0` specifies that the element has no height initially.
- `.target:hover > .el` specifies that when the parent is hovered over, target a child `.el` within it and use the `--max-height` variable which was defined by JavaScript.
- `el.scrollHeight` is the height of the element including overflow, which will change dynamically based on the content of the element.
- `el.style.setProperty(...)` sets the `--max-height` CSS variable which is used to specify the `max-height` of the element the target is hovered over, allowing it to transition smoothly from 0 to auto.
- Causes reflow on each animation frame, which will be laggy if there are a large number of elements beneath the element that is transitioning in height.

```html
<div class="trigger">
  Hover me to see a height transition.
  <div class="el">Additional content</div>
</div>
```

```css
.el {
  transition: max-height 0.5s;
  overflow: hidden;
  max-height: 0;
}

.trigger:hover > .el {
  max-height: var(--max-height);
}
```

```js
let el = document.querySelector('.el')
let height = el.scrollHeight
el.style.setProperty('--max-height', height + 'px')
```
