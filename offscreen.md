# Completely hides an element visually and positionally in the DOM while still allowing it to be accessible.

Provides an alternative to `display: none` (not readable by screen readers) and `visibility: hidden` (takes up physical space in the DOM).

- Remove all borders.
- Use `clip` to indicate that no part of the element should be shown.
- Make the height and width of the element 1px.
- Negate the elements height and width using `margin: -1px`.
- Hide the element's overflow.
- Remove all padding.
- Position the element absolutely so that it does not take up space in the DOM.

```html
<a class="button" href="https://google.com"> Learn More <span class="offscreen"> about pants</span> </a>
```

```css
.offscreen {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
}
```
